Title: System and Method for AI-Assisted Design Using Form Isolation, Systematic Variation, and Integrated Design Principles

Abstract

This invention presents an advanced system and method for AI-assisted design that leverages object groupings within computer-aided design (CAD) models to represent design principles and element hierarchies. The system employs a novel approach of form isolation through systematic variation, where all visual properties, spatial relationships, and contextual elements are varied while maintaining the core form. This process generates a diverse dataset of images and semantic labels, which is used to train a text-to-image AI model. The resulting system enables designers to generate new designs through natural language prompts while preserving design intent and fundamental principles. By integrating established design methodologies, particularly those of Rowena Reed Kostellow, this innovation enhances the quality and relevance of AI-generated design outputs.

Background of the Invention

The field of AI-assisted design has seen significant advancements, yet challenges persist in maintaining designer control and incorporating fundamental design principles. Existing systems often lack the nuanced understanding of form, space, and visual relationships that are crucial in industrial and product design.

Rowena Reed Kostellow's "Elements of Design" provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and teaching three-dimensional design. Her approach emphasizes the importance of abstract visual relationships, the hierarchy of dominant, subdominant, and subordinate elements, and the critical role of spatial relationships, balance, proportion, and movement within a design.

This invention builds upon Kostellow's principles and addresses the limitations of current AI-assisted design systems by introducing a method that preserves core design intent while exploring a wide range of variations.

Summary of the Invention

The key aspects of the invention include:

1. Object Grouping in CAD Models: Designers organize objects using layers, groups, or tags to represent design principles, spatial relationships, and element hierarchies.

2. Form Isolation through Systematic Variation: The system generates variations by altering all visual properties, spatial relationships, and contextual elements while maintaining the core form of the design.

3. Integrated Design Principles: Kostellow's teachings on balance, proportion, movement, and the use of negative space are incorporated into the variation generation and AI training processes.

4. Advanced Semantic Label Generation: The system creates detailed semantic labels that describe not only visual attributes but also spatial relationships, proportions, and design principles applied.

5. AI Model Training: A text-to-image AI model is trained on the generated dataset, learning to understand and apply complex design concepts.

6. AI-Assisted Design Interface: Designers interact with the trained model through a user interface that allows for text-based design generation while providing insights into the applied design principles.

Detailed Description of the Invention

1. Object Grouping in CAD Model

Designers create 3D models using CAD software and organize objects to represent design principles and hierarchies:

- Layers: Assign objects to layers representing roles (dominant, subdominant, subordinate) and design functions (e.g., "establishes rhythm," "defines negative space").
- Groups: Organize objects based on functional, aesthetic, or spatial relationships.
- Tags: Attach metadata describing design characteristics (e.g., "creates tension," "balancing element").

Example: In a chair design, the seat might be tagged as "dominant," the backrest as "subdominant," and armrests as "subordinate," with additional tags like "establishes horizontal plane" or "creates negative space beneath."

2. Form Isolation through Systematic Variation

The system generates variations while maintaining the core form:

a. Visual Properties:
   - Colors and Textures: Vary palettes while preserving or contrasting relationships between elements.
   - Materials: Explore different finishes to affect perception of form, weight, and balance.

b. Spatial Manipulations:
   - Scaling and Rotating: Adjust sizes and orientations of subdominant and subordinate elements to explore balance and tension.
   - Positioning: Shift elements within defined parameters to study effects on spatial relationships.

c. Negative Space Exploration:
   - Void Manipulation: Adjust spaces between elements to study impact on overall design.

d. Contextual Variations:
   - Lighting: Alter direction, intensity, and color of light sources to emphasize different aspects of the form.
   - Environment: Change backgrounds and surrounding elements to explore the design in various contexts.

Algorithm for Systematic Variation:

```python
def generate_variations(cad_model):
    variations = []
    for _ in range(NUM_VARIATIONS):
        variation = copy.deepcopy(cad_model)
        
        # Vary visual properties
        vary_colors_and_textures(variation)
        vary_materials(variation)
        
        # Spatial manipulations
        vary_subdominant_elements(variation)
        vary_subordinate_elements(variation)
        
        # Negative space exploration
        adjust_void_spaces(variation)
        
        # Contextual variations
        vary_lighting(variation)
        vary_environment(variation)
        
        variations.append(variation)
    
    return variations

def vary_subdominant_elements(model):
    subdominant_elements = get_elements_by_tag(model, "subdominant")
    for element in subdominant_elements:
        scale_factor = random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)
        rotation = random.uniform(0, 360)
        new_position = calculate_new_position(element)
        
        apply_transformation(element, scale_factor, rotation, new_position)

# Similar functions for other variation types
```

3. Semantic Label Generation

The system generates detailed semantic labels for each variation:

- Spatial Relationships: "The dominant seat plane intersects with the subdominant backrest at a 100-degree angle, creating a subtle tension."
- Proportions and Scale: "Armrests (subordinate) are scaled to 1/4 the width of the seat, establishing a harmonious proportion."
- Balance and Movement: "Asymmetrical arrangement of elements guides the eye in a clockwise motion around the form."
- Negative Space: "Void beneath the seat creates a sense of lightness, contrasting with the solid upper structure."

Advanced Design Terminology:
- "Dynamic equilibrium achieved through counterbalancing of curved and straight elements."
- "Rhythmic repetition of vertical supports creates visual continuity."

4. AI Model Training

The training process incorporates:

- Gestalt Principles: Train the model to recognize and apply concepts like closure, continuity, and figure-ground relationships.
- Design Vocabulary: Integrate Kostellow's terminology into the training data to enhance the model's understanding of design concepts.
- Spatial Reasoning: Develop the model's ability to understand and generate 3D spatial relationships from 2D representations.

5. AI-Assisted Design Interface

The user interface includes:

- Text-to-Image Generation: Allow designers to input text prompts describing desired designs.
- Design Principle Visualization: Provide visual feedback on how generated designs adhere to Kostellow's principles.
- Interactive Exploration: Enable designers to adjust parameters and see real-time changes in the application of design principles.

Example interaction:
Designer: "Generate a chair with a dominant horizontal plane and subordinate vertical supports, emphasizing negative space."
System: *Generates multiple design options*
System Explanation: "Design A emphasizes the horizontal plane of the seat as the dominant element. The vertical supports are subordinate, creating rhythmic repetition. Negative space beneath the seat adds a sense of lightness, adhering to Kostellow's principle of activating void spaces."
