Abstract

This invention describes a system and method for automating the generation of training data tailored for AI-assisted design applications. The system leverages the hierarchical structure of objects within CAD models, generating diverse variations through systematic manipulation of visual properties, camera viewpoints, lighting, and backgrounds, while critically maintaining the core design form. This "form isolation" technique addresses a key challenge in training AI models for design: preventing overfitting to irrelevant aesthetic qualities. By decoupling form from style, the AI learns to generalize design intent more effectively. The system automatically generates descriptive semantic labels for each variation, facilitating the training of a text-to-image AI model. A sophisticated user interface empowers designers to generate renderings via natural language prompts, offering fine-grained control over CMF properties and other visual attributes while preserving design integrity. Advanced features such as location-based backgrounds, automated cost analysis, design callouts, and character continuity further streamline the design workflow and enhance collaborative capabilities.

Background of the Invention

Field of the Invention

This invention lies at the confluence of artificial intelligence (AI), computer-aided design (CAD), computer graphics, machine learning, and design theory, specifically addressing the automated creation of training datasets for AI-driven design applications. The core innovation lies in the methodology of generating a training corpus that emphasizes the isolation of design form, thereby enabling the AI model to learn and generalize design intent more effectively.

Description of the Related Art

Traditional design and rendering workflows are resource-intensive, requiring significant manual effort and specialized skills. Existing AI-assisted design tools, while promising, often lack the precision and control required by professional designers, particularly regarding the preservation of design intent and the ability to manipulate specific attributes like CMF properties independently of form.

Previous attempts to automate training data generation for AI models have focused on general image processing techniques (e.g., US20190156487A1, image segmentation and masking) or domain-specific applications like computer-aided engineering (US20220215145A1, mesh generation) and automated driving systems (US11308357B2, sensor data). However, these approaches do not address the unique challenges inherent in AI-assisted design, specifically the need to isolate and preserve the core design form during the training process. They also lack the comprehensive feature set and integrated workflow offered by this invention. A key differentiator of this invention is the explicit focus on form isolation, achieved by systematically varying all other visual elements except the core form. This approach directly addresses the problem of overfitting, a common challenge in machine learning where a model becomes too specialized to the training data and fails to generalize to new examples. By training the AI on a dataset where the form remains constant while all other attributes vary, the model learns to recognize and generate the form independently of specific styles, colors, textures, or viewpoints. This is crucial for enabling designers to manipulate these attributes freely through natural language prompts without altering the fundamental design. The provided code snippet exemplifies this principle by demonstrating the random application of materials and lighting to different parts of a CAD model (defined by sublayers), while the underlying geometry of the model remains unchanged. This code forms a part of the Automated Data Generation Module, which is a core component of this invention. It demonstrates how the system programmatically generates variations in visual properties to create a diverse training dataset.

Problems to be Solved by the Invention

This invention directly addresses several crucial limitations of current AI-assisted design technologies:

Overfitting to Irrelevant Aesthetic Qualities: Existing AI models trained on conventional datasets often overfit to specific styles, colors, textures, lighting, or camera angles, hindering their ability to generalize design intent and limiting the designer's control over these attributes.

Manual and Time-Consuming Rendering Workflows: Traditional rendering processes are labor-intensive and slow, hindering rapid design exploration and iteration.

Lack of Seamless CAD and AI Integration: Current AI design tools often exist as separate entities, requiring cumbersome data transfer and limiting the integration with established CAD workflows.

Insufficient Designer Control over Generated Outputs: Many AI tools lack the fine-grained control that designers need to manipulate specific design attributes while preserving the overall form and intent.

Limited Collaboration and Feedback Capabilities: Traditional design review processes can be inefficient, lacking tools for streamlined feedback and collaborative iteration.

Lack of Design Analysis and Optimization: Existing AI tools primarily focus on generating visually appealing outputs but lack the ability to analyze designs for potential functional or manufacturing issues.

Summary of the Invention

This invention provides a system and method for automating the generation of training data for AI-assisted design applications, focusing on form isolation to prevent overfitting and enhance designer control. The key components and functionalities include:

Object Grouping in CAD Models: Leveraging existing CAD functionalities (layers, groups, tags) to define hierarchical object relationships that reflect design intent. This structured organization facilitates semantic understanding and automated label generation. This structure mirrors the way designers think about their creations, breaking down complex forms into meaningful components and sub-systems. The code example provided demonstrates how object groupings (represented by sublayers in Rhino) are used to apply materials to specific parts of the model. This granular control over material application is essential for generating diverse variations and training the AI to understand the relationship between form and material.

Form Isolation through Systematic Variation: Generating diverse variations of the CAD model by systematically altering visual properties (CMF), camera viewpoints, lighting conditions, and backgrounds while maintaining the core design form as the invariant element. This form isolation is the central innovation, enabling the AI model to learn the form independently of other visual attributes and preventing overfitting. The code snippet illustrates this by randomly assigning materials and lighting to the different parts of the chair model, effectively creating numerous variations while the chair's shape remains constant. This process, applied across a wide range of parameters, generates a robust training dataset that emphasizes form recognition.

Automated Semantic Label Generation: Automatically creating descriptive text labels for each generated variation, capturing object groupings, applied variations, and design intent. These labels provide the textual context necessary for training the AI model and facilitate natural language interaction with the system. The code example shows how these labels are constructed by combining the class name (e.g., "chair"), instance name, viewpoint description, lighting description, and material descriptions. This structured approach ensures consistency and clarity in the labels, allowing the AI to effectively associate text prompts with specific visual attributes.

AI Model Training using LoRA: Fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This efficient method adapts the model to the specific design data without retraining the entire model, preserving computational resources and accelerating the training process. LoRA is particularly well-suited for this application as it allows the model to learn the nuances of the specific design while retaining the general image generation capabilities of the pre-trained model.

AI-Assisted Design Interface with Advanced Features: A user-friendly interface enabling designers to interact with the trained AI model through natural language prompts. This interface includes advanced features that streamline the design workflow and enhance creative exploration:
